[(S)can system log for AppArmor events] / (F)inish
Reading log entries from /var/log/audit/audit.log.
Updating AppArmor profiles in /etc/apparmor.d.

Profile:  /home/marc/example.sh
Execute:  /usr/bin/touch
Severity: 3

----
Inherit: Creates a rule that is denoted by “ix” within the profile, causes the executed binary to inherit permissions from the parent profile.
Child: Creates a rule that is denoted by “Cx” within the profile, requires a sub-profile to be created within the parent profile and rules must be separately generated for this child (prompts will appear when running scans on the parent).
Deny: Creates a rule that AppArmor prepends with “deny” at the start of the line within the profile, causes the parents access to the resource be denied.
Abort: Exits the AppArmor program without saving any changes.
Finish: Exits the AppArmor program but WILL save changes.
